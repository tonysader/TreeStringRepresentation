# TreeStringRepresentation
You enter the tree as preorder, and as output it will show you the same tree as postorder and inorder.
There are 3 ways to represent a binary tree.
PreOrder: It shows the root then the left child then the right child.
InOrder: It shows the left child then the root then the left child.
PostOrder: It shows you the left child then the right child then the root.

This code helps you to enter your tree and it will shows you the 3 Strings representing the ways of showing your binary tree.
